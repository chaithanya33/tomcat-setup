after login with public ip and 8080 

then go to mangers u got this error

#By default the Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat. If you wish to modify this restriction, you'll need to edit the Manager's context.xml file.


so we can modify these 

cd /apache-tomcat-10.1.49 / main folder 


to find any files use this commands like find or locate 

# first we need to install locate package //sudo yum install mlocate -y
then update db //sudo updatedb



# locate context.xml

#  cd /root/apache-tomcat-10.1.49/webapps
