5) if u need to start any service you need to go to bin folder then we can see file startup.sh we need to execute this file in server

after login with public ip and 8080 

then go to mangers u got this error

#By default the Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat. If you wish to modify this restriction, you'll need to edit the Manager's context.xml file.


so we can modify these 

cd /apache-tomcat-10.1.49 / main folder 


to find any files use this commands like find or locate 

# first we need to install locate package //sudo yum install mlocate -y
then update db //sudo updatedb



# locate context.xml

#  cd /root/apache-tomcat-10.1.49/webapps

# the u can see war file here 

cp /path/to/myapp.war /root/apache-tomcat-10.1.49/webapps/



# then restart tomcat server 

cd /root/apache-tomcat-10.1.49/bin
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh


# Tomcat will automatically extract and deploy your app into:

/root/apache-tomcat-10.1.49/webapps/myapp/
